# Peer-to-Peer Messaging Application

## Overview
The Peer-to-Peer Messaging Application is a Python-based project designed for simple and direct communication between multiple peers. Using socket programming and multithreading, the application facilitates real-time message exchange over a network, allowing users to connect, send, and receive messages with ease.

## Features
- **Peer Connection Management**
  - Maintains an active list of connected peers using a global dictionary.
  - Supports dynamic updating of peer information when connection messages are received.
- **Multi-threaded Operation**
  - Uses separate threads for handling incoming connections and client messages to ensure smooth communication.
- **Local IP Detection**
  - Automatically determines and displays your local IP address for external sharing with peers.
- **Interactive Command-Line Interface**
  - Provides a menu-driven interface to send messages, query active peers, and connect to new peers.
- **Mandatory Messaging**
  - Automatically sends predefined mandatory messages to two specified IP addresses upon startup.
- **Customizable Identification**
  - Users set a team name which is appended to every outgoing message, making communication clear and organized.

## Prerequisites
- **Python Version:** Python 3.x is required.
- **Libraries:** Uses Python's standard libraries (`socket`, `threading`, `sys`, and `time`) â€“ no external dependencies are necessary.
